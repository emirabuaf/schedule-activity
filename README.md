Implementation:
1. What libraries did you use? What are they used for? Why did you choose them
specifically?

I only used CSS library Tailwind. I chose it because it was one of the optional choices given in the assignment and apart from that Tailwind is the tool which has become one of the most preffered CSS library in the market.

2. What improvements or new features would you add if you had more time to work on
the problem?

As of now i made the url endpoint city static with Berlin. I could let the users choose wherever they want by using their geolocation. With the api i use it wasn't very practical to implement the longtitude and latitudes. Another new feature i would add would be to create a calendar and book between certain hours. In the current implementation if it is booked any day then i don't let it be picked again. I could make it depending on the date as well.

3. Which parts did you find most difficult and which parts did you spend the most time
with?

I spent most time doing the design pretty. Secondly i spent for refactoring the code and moving some logic out of the components.

4. What are key things to consider when deploying this application for customer
use/production?

Environment Configuration, scalability,testing,performance optimization
